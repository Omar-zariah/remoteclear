# RemoteClear SaaS Platform

A modern React TypeScript application for RemoteClear, a B2B SaaS platform designed to solve trust and transparency problems in the remote work landscape.

## 🎯 Core Concept

RemoteClear is a specialized B2B software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that addresses critical trust and transparency issues in modern remote work:

- **The Problem**: Companies struggle to verify the employment status and availability of remote workers, leading to risks like "over-employment" and reduced productivity.
- **The Solution**: RemoteClear acts as a neutral, third-party registry providing a single source of truth for employment verification.

## 🏗️ Foundation of Trust

The platform is built on three foundational pillars:

1. **Digital Fingerprint ID**: A unique, secure, and verifiable digital identity created for each worker after a one-time, robust identity check.
2. **Workplace Passport**: A user-friendly dashboard that employees control to view and manage their verified employment status.
3. **Continuous Authentication**: Periodic "Pulse Checks" ensure verification data remains current and accounts stay secure.
